## Why do I want to code SVG by my hand?

When I were studying Reflex, a Python web framework, I found that reflex can use `.svg` file as image, may be it's not unusual. And I tried to open SVG file. Then, I could open it as text; xml, I was suprised. And serached on the internet how can I draw or code SVG file. I found some way to do that, to use some software to write image and save as SVG file format, or hand writing.

Then, I searched more, about how to code SVG, and I found this website.
